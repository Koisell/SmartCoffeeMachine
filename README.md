In 2017 a complete refactory will be done. In this new version the whole stack is inside a Raspberry PI 3.
The hardware and facial recognition parts will be written in Python 3. A Flask webservice and SQLite3 database will make the server side lighter. Finally the website will be rewrite in HTML5.


## Thanks
